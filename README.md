# Mapbox Maps SDKs for iOS and macOS

Mapbox Maps SDK v10 is now available at [mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios). v10 offers superior performance, features, and developer experience, and is the recommended mobile SDK solution for all Mapbox customers. Mapbox maintains this repo to address bug fixes and security vulnerabilities.

The Mapbox Maps SDK for iOS is an open-source framework for embedding interactive map views with scalable, customizable vector maps into Cocoa Touch applications on iOS 9.0 and above using Objective-C, Swift, or Interface Builder. It takes stylesheets that conform to the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/), applies them to vector tiles that conform to the [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/), and renders them using Mapbox GL Native.
